SQLALCHEMY CONTRAINTS 
objectives 
    1. define the contraints and validation in data processing 
    2. restric databse input to specifi formats using contraints


to keep invalid values out of our databse we can use SQLAlchemy contraints.
These contraints work at a base level to control the data to the database.

UNIQUE AND NULLABLE CONTRAINTS
certain contrainsta can be added directly to the column as we define it.
the nullable contrainst allows us to make sure that the values added to the columns are not null.
we can define this by adding the argument nullable=false to the column contructor.

if its requires that the vlies in your columns be unique then the unique contraint can be specified by adding the argument unique=True to the 
column contructor.

CHECKCONTRAINTS
CheckContraint can be creted for columns and tables.
the text of the CheckContrain is passed directly through to the database.
